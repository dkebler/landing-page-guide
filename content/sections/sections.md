### About

Adding a section to the landing page is as easy as adding a md file in the ```content/sections/``` directory.  Each md file you create in that directory will need some settings at the top of the page called *frontmatter*.  The settings work the same as in ```config.toml```, use a hashtag in front to turn one off.  The *frontmatter* must be proceeded and followed by ```+++```

Here is an example *frontmatter* you can copy into your new md file.  It's easier though to just duplicate existing section md file and then edit instead.

```toml
+++
weight = 10 # weight determines the order of sections.  Lower weights are first
Title = "It's all About Me"  ## the title of the section, used as the navbar link by default
link_text = "About"  ## will override the Title setting for use as the navbar link text
# navbar = false  ## create a section that doesn't have a corresponding navbar menu item...like a footer
# hidden = true  ## hide the section without deleting this file
# align = "left" ## aligns all elements in the section, center is the default
+++
```

### Hero - a special section

The very first section of a landing page is traditionally called a "Hero" and has a covering photo and large headline text.  This template allows you to easily do that in the ```config.toml``` file.  Alternatively if you want more control you can turn off the built in Hero section by enabling (removing the hashtage) of the  ```custom_hero = true``` setting.  Then you can simply create your own ```hero.md``` section file for the Hero or if you want none at all.

### Create and Edit

The easy way to create a new section is simply to right click in Atom on a .md file and choose "duplicate" to copy an existing section md file as a new one.  Change the frontmatter settings as you wish and then edit/delete the markdown content that follows the *frontmatter*.
