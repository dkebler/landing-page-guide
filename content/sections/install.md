First off...If you are an experienced Hugo user then go to the [quick start - TL;DR ](#quick).

### The Tools

To be able to make your own cusomtized landing pages quickly and easily you'll need to install minimum of two tools and then grab a copy of this starter page's files to get you rolling. The absolute minimum tools you'll need to install are two

### 1. {{< link url="https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/" text="Hugo" display="tab" >}}  - a static site Generator

{{< youtube id="7G6TcT1liQw" caption="Video - How to install Hugo on Windows" >}}

{{< box btn-bar >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_Windows-64bit.zip" text="Hugo for Windows" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_macOS-64bit.zip" text="Hugo For Mac" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/" text="Hugo for Linux" display="window" >}}
{{< /box >}}

**--AND--**

### 2. {{< link url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="tab" >}} a text/IDE editor

The following button will take you to the Atom website and offer a download button for Atom for your operating system.  Install it as you would any application in your operating system

{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="window" >}}

Possibly the hardest part of building your custom landing page is getting these two tools installed!

### The Starter Site Code

Once you have Hugo and Atom installed you are ready to get a copy of the starter site files. So first decide on a directory in which to put it on your machine.  Then download the zip archive file using the button below.  Then extract it into that directory.  Then open that folder in Atom and you'll be ready to start editing your own landing page. This video shows using this guide as a starter but you'll use the actual starter site.  For the Hugo and Github saavy you can instead just clone the starter repostity.
