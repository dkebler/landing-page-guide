**YEA!** If you completed successfully the installation section you are ready to start editing **YOUR** own landing page.  You'll going find easy to edit an existing landing page than to start your own from scratch.  That's why you'll be using the starter site's files.

### What's Important

In the folder you just made containing the starter site's files you need to concentrate on just three places.  The first is the `config.toml` file in the root of the folder.  The second is the `content/sections` subfolder and the .md files inside.  md is short for Markdown the textual editing format you'll be using.  The third is the `assets/images` folder. That's the only places you'll need to put your attention to create your own personalized landing page.  The rest of the directory's folders can be safely ignored until you are ready for more advanced topics like tweaking the styling.
