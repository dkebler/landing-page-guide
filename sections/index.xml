      <description>The heart and soul of your landing page is the configuration file config.toml. So start the editing of the &amp;ldquo;your&amp;rdquo; site by bringing up the config.toml file in Atom. You&amp;rsquo;ll find it in the root of your starter directory.
The Layout It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. Eeach line in the config file is a setting. You can turn the setting &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; by simply putting a hashtag(#) before it. If you remove the hashtag the value for that setting will be used.</description>

      <description>About Adding a section to the landing page is as easy as adding a md file in the content/sections/ directory. Each md file you create in that directory will need some settings at the top of the page called frontmatter. The settings work the same as in config.toml, use a hashtag in front to turn one off. The frontmatter must be proceeded and followed by +++
Here is an example frontmatter you can copy into your new md file.</description>

      <description>Learn it Teaching you the details about writing markdown is beyond the scope of this guide. He are two links to get you started, a markdown tutorial, and a markdown cheatsheet. If you prefer here is video to get you going.
 Honestly though the best way to learn markdown is to examine some examples. Luckily this guide you are using as a starter is chock full of markdown in the content/sections/ directory.</description>

      <title>Plugins (i.e Shortcodes)</title>
      <link>https://dkebler.github.io/landingpage-guide/sections/plugins/</link>

      <description>What are they As explained in the markdown section above shortcodes can be plugged into the middle of your markdown files to give them added functionality. Each shortcode is invoked with either a {{&amp;lt; name &amp;gt;}} or {{% name %}} and possibly a closing {{&amp;lt; /name &amp;gt;}} if they enclose some more content. It all depends on the nature of the shortcode.
 This landing page theme currently has 12 shortcodes that you might plugin and will likely have more in the future (make your requests).</description>

      <description>SOME CHANGES
After all that work getting your new landing page site looking the way you want it it&amp;rsquo;s time to &amp;ldquo;Deploy&amp;rdquo; your landing page out somewhere on the Internet where everyone can see it.
Generate the site folder During page development using the hugo server command Hugo has been generating your site&amp;rsquo;s files and placing them in memory and serving them from there via localhost:1313.
Now you are just going to run just the command hugo and it will generate an actual folder of your site&amp;rsquo;s files that can then be uploaded to a server out on the Internet.</description>

      <description>For those who are Hugo experienced and know what they are doing and are able to &amp;ldquo;figure out&amp;rdquo; the details simply clone the starter repo, sync the theme submodule and then edit the markdown files in the conent/sections directory and settings in config.toml.
If you really know what you are doing and prefer to start from scratch by all means just clone (or submodule) the theme into an existing Hugo project&amp;rsquo;s themes folder</description>
