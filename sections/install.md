This guide was written for someone with little or no experience using Hugo or with (CSS/Javascript/HTML).  If you are experienced then go to the [quick start](#tldr).

To be able to make your own cusomtized landing pages quickly and easily you'll need to install minimum of two tools and then grab a copy of the starter respository. The absolute minimum tools you'll need to install are

{{< box btn-bar >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_Windows-64bit.zip" text="Hugo for Windows" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_macOS-64bit.zip" text="Hugo For Mac" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/" text="Hugo for Linux" display="window" >}}
{{< /box >}}

and

{{< link url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="tab" >}} a text based editor and the Atom is highly recommended.

{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="window" >}}
