This guide was written for someone with little or no experience using Hugo or with (CSS/Javascript/HTML).  If you are experienced then go to the [quick start](#tldr).

To be able to make your own cusomtized landing pages quickly and easily you'll need to install minimum of two tools and then grab a copy of the this guide respository to use as a starter. The absolute minimum tools you'll need to install are

{{< link url="https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/" text="Hugo" display="tab" >}}  - a static site Generator

{{< box btn-bar >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_Windows-64bit.zip" text="Hugo for Windows" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.19/hugo_0.19_macOS-64bit.zip" text="Hugo For Mac" >}}
{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/" text="Hugo for Linux" display="window" >}}

and

{{< link url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="tab" >}} a text/IDE editor .

{{< link type="btn" icon="download" url="https://atom.io" text="Atom" display="window" >}}

Once the Atom editor is installed you'll need to install an Atom package *terminal-panel* to be able to lanuch Hugo from within the editor.

Possibly the hardest part of building your custom landing page is getting these two tools installed!

Once you have Hugo and Atom installed you are ready to download a copy of this landing page guide's source respository to use as a starter.  First decide on a directory in which to put it on you machine.  Then download the zip archive file.  Then extract it into that directory.  Then open that folder in Atom and you'll be ready to start editing your own landing page.
